# Introduction

The Lumina Programming Language

Lumina is an eager-by-default natively compiled functional programming language with the core goals of readibility, practicality, compiler-driven development and simplicity.

It aims to be a high-level general-purpose language, but also support systems-level functionality such as raw pointer arithmetics to allow for high-level abstractions to be built on top of low-level high performance Lumina code.
